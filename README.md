# PheRS: Phenotype Risk Scores Calculation
PheRS is a Python package for calculating phenotype 
risk scores using various statistical methods. 
It leverages the All of Us OMOP database and supports 
custom datasets. The package provides functionality for 
calculating weights based on prevalence, logistic regression, 
log-linear regression, and Cox proportional hazards regression.
It adapted the **["The phers R package, Aref et al. (2022)"](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac619)**.
